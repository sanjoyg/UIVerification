UI Verification Tool

While we were QA automation using Selenium, we gota to a pretty good state of covering the functional aspects of the code.
However we still were plagued by issues such as UI alignment on different version of the browser or on a certain Page. This 
tool was created to basically run an automation test that would check for UI alignment of browser pages using image comparison.
